 JSX Restrictions

 =====================================
 Notes on states
 - used only in components/containers and should be only used by few components as necessary in an application, updates
   entire DOM
 - use functions based "components" as often as possible, this only requires a portion of the DOM to be updated

** Common Pattern: You can pass events such as clicks to the parent component from a child component
